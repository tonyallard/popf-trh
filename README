About
-----

This directory contains the planner POPF-TRH.  


The original incarnation of POPF, a planner for domains with time windows.  
For more details, see the papers:

"A TIL-Relaxed Heuristic for Planning with Time Windows", T. Allard, 
P. Haslum, Ch. Gretton, ICAPS 2018.

It is built upon the POPF2 planner. The original POPF planner is described in 
the ICAPS 2010 paper "Forward-Chaining Partial-Order Planning." by Amanda Coles, 
Andrew Coles, Maria Fox and Derek Long. The POPF2 version extends POPF by introducing 
any-time search, allowing it to optimise solution quality.

Compiling
---------

POPF2 requires:
- cmake ( http://www.cmake.org/ )
- the CBC mixed integer programming solver ( https://projects.coin-or.org/Cbc/ )
- perl, bison and flex to build the parser

These are packaged with most linux distributions - on Ubuntu/Debian, the
following should suffice:

sudo apt-get install cmake coinor-libcbc-dev coinor-libclp-dev \
                     coinor-libcoinutils-dev bison flex


After that, run ./build

In order to run POPF-TRH, you will need a planner to solve the TIL-Relaxed 
planning problem. Setting the parameters for this planner can be done in:

./src/colin/TRH/TRH.cpp

We used the standard POPF2 planner in our experiments.


Running
-------

Run:

./plan <domain> <problem> <solution filename>

As POPF2 is an any-time planer, it will save sequentially numbered plans.
